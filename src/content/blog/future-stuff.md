Let's start somewhere else: Why am I even exploring FPGA boards? I've been doing a lot of soul searching recently, especially in a professional capacity. What do I want to work with? I am currently studying Electrical Engineering on 5th semester, and, with being a bit older than my peers, I'm getting kind of tired of studying. As such, I've been considering not even doing a [candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_(degree)), and just diving directly into the professional world when I finish my bachelor's in a years time. However! New and exciting possibilities have arisen, with the advent of a new way of doing a candidate, the ["Erhvervskandidat"](https://github.com/HannahField/Erhvervskandidat-pdf/blob/main/Erhvervskandidaten_ECE_V1.7_maj2025_ENG.pdf), which my university has translated to "The Industrial M.Sc". Essentially, it allows you to do your candidate half-time, while working part-time on the side in a relevant role (specifically 25 hours per week on average). Where am I going with all this? Well, to partake, I need to find a company that will employ me. And thus, my search has begun.
