        What is this blog? Good question. I'm honestly not entirely sure yet 🤷‍♀️.
        Alright, let's try a different question: Why do a blog? Well, this
        answer is two-fold! Firstly, I've been wanting to get better at
        documenting my projects, but it's probably more to do with wanting
        accountability. I have, in the past(!), been very good at starting and
        then deserting projects. I'm hoping that documenting my process via a
        blog can help with retention! Plus, I just started new ADHD meds, so
        maybe that'll help too 🤷‍♀️.
